The App Uses an Emulated CosmosDb. I have created a support api to create the database and container in an automated way (I felt that a warmup/startup class might be overkill for this project, that's why I used the support controller for this purpose), please start by running that API.
Integration tests can be found in the postman collection, please make sure to import the environment as well
